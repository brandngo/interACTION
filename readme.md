# interACTION: an optimal solution to the rising levels of depression and mental illness as a result of COVID-19 induced social isolation and loneliness

As isolation and loneliness increase during the pandemic, people are left to communicate through social media and online methods. 53% of Americans reported that their mental health was negatively impacted by COVID-19 related issues, while Canadians are reporting their highest levels of anxiety (23%) and depression (15%) higher than during the first COVID-19 wave.

Sometimes, all you need is a person to talk to and to listen to you without ever judging, because they don’t know you and are likely going through the same! 
## That’s where interACTION comes in as the best solution.

interACTION is an online social platform where users can ANONYMOUSLY (if they choose to!) interact with a wholesome community of members experiencing the same feelings as they are. They can choose to chat in the channel that best matches their interests, or they can create their own! They can also access our informational multi-tab resource page for how to best feel better, and the best part: they can choose to video chat with anyone from our platform! Someone who can lend an ear will do wonders for one’s feelings of loneliness and depression.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
